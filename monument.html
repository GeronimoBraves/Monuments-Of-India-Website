However, the said purpose was never met and at present Golghar serves as one of the famous historical monuments in Bihar. Resembling a beehive, this building features no pillars, but a spiral staircase having 145 steps that take you to the topmost part of the dome.</p>

Jal Mahal has been constructed on a huge plot of approximately 11 acres. It is situated in the middle of the huge pond, but there is a bridge to reach the monument. Lime and stone have been used in the construction of this beautiful temple in the shape of a small palace in the middle of the huge lake.</p>

                  <p>The Asigarh Fort or Hansi Fort has a chequered history of its own. The excavation of ancient coins right from the BCE timeline indicate a lengthy history of several settlements along the mound upon which the fort stands today. It is believed by historians that the original structure was developed by Harshavardhana, the iconic emperor or possibly Prabhakaravardhana, his grandfather. They belonged to the Vardhana or Pushyabhuti Dynasty. The current fort seems to have been built with materials dating back to the previous fort in 7th century CE.</p>
